pi-steroid
##########

pi-steroid is a client for [Asteroid][asteroid] aka [pijs.io][pijs], a cloud framework for JavaScript development and deployment on the Raspberry Pi.

## What does it do?

pi-steroid runs on your Raspberry Pi and connects it to an [asteroid] server. Once your Raspberry Pi is connected, you can program it in javascript in the cloud. Your code is updated on the device in realtime.

## How to install?

The easiest way to install pi-steroid on a Raspberry Pi is to use the auto-installation script described in [pijs.io documentation][pijsdoc].

You can also try pi-steroid on any computer that has nodejs and npm installed. Just install this package and run pijs-client:

    $ sudo npm install -g pi-steroid
    $ pi-steroid

## How does it work?

pi-steroid uses the [node-ddp-client][node-ddp-client] library to connect to an asteroid server. It subscribes to a feed from the server that describes this device and the code it is supposed to run.
